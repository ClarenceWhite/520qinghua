## About
This is a simple application which link several scripts on my server and a Wechat message pusher (WxPusher), it is developed just for fun.
When you subscribe the channel on Wechat, you will receive a piece of Tawdry love letters every hour.
## Background
Pronounced in Chinese, 5.20 (wu er ling) is the same as "I love you (wo ai ni)" and in recent years it has become another Chinese Valentine's Day (the other being Tanabata, the traditional Chinese Valentine's Day).
The author has developed this little project in order to make love words to accompany those who are still single on this day, so that they do not feel lonely.
